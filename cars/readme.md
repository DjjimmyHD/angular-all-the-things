[Bind Forms to Objects](https://learn.galvanize.com/content/gSchool/angular-curriculum/master/10%20-%20Building%20Apps/10%20-%20Bind%20Forms%20to%20Objects.md)


#### Notes ####
- forms are passed as objects
- we can control the name of the object as well as the key and values
- ng submit passes the data
- using the delete operations should make us think about how we can use multiple controllers in one component to achieve different effects
