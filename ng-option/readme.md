[ngOptions](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngOptions)

#### Notes ####
- ng-options work similarly to ng repeat define what key you want in the object and use the controller to tag the function or array or object
- ng-options has a ton of ways to sort and group our selects see documentation for all
- there are a ton of built in directives for angular it is best to think of them as event handlers on steroids
- use if you are trying to manipulate the DOM at attribute, element name, comment or CSS class
